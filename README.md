# LBD catalog

In our catalog, we have analysed 82,277 CR sequences from 11,806 representative microbial genomes covering the whole prokaryotic species phylogeny and have classified them according to their LBD types using a de novo LBD family annotation method. Here, LBDs profiles from our novel families are avaiable for clasifying custom protein fasta sequences.
